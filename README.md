> `This is the second DSPS student competition on the application of AI for pavement condition monitoring` <br>
> This competition consists of Track 1 and Track 2. 
>
> My Team is working on Track 2 which is model-centric and involves detection, and estimation of the severity of different <br>
types of pavement distresses.
